## Youth Medical Association NYC

### Mission Statement
	Youth Medical Association is a non-profit organization, founded in New York City by high schoolers at Bronx Science. We aim to support those who are passionate in pursuing a career in the medical field. Unfortunately, there are many individuals across the city who have a desire to pursue a career in the medical field, but they may not have the proper opportunities and guidance to prepare to pursue such. They may not be in a school that has many guidance or individuals interested in the medical field, and thus, making it difficult for them to understand and try pursuing the medical field. However, with the efforts and collaboration among students and organizations/institutions, we want to bring various opportunities and guidance to students. We want to offer internships, volunteering opportunities, shadowing sessions, guidance, and presentations regarding a plethora of topics.
